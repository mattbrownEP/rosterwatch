# Production Deployment Guide

## Status: Ready for Fresh Deployment

Your Staff Directory Monitor application is ready for production deployment with the complete 225-institution dataset.

## Pre-Deployment Summary

✅ **Database**: Complete with 225 college athletic department URLs  
✅ **Migration System**: Updated to use complete dataset  
✅ **Application**: All core files present and functional  
✅ **Environment**: All required variables configured  

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Fresh Production Deployment
Click the **Deploy** button in your Replit interface to create a new production deployment. This will:
- Deploy the latest code with complete migration system
- Create a fresh production database 
- Automatically populate with all 225 institutions
- Provide your colleagues with the complete dataset

### 2. Post-Deployment Verification
After deployment completes:
1. Visit your new production URL
2. Verify the dashboard shows "225 Total URLs" 
3. Test the Open Records workflow
4. Confirm email notifications work

### 3. Share with Colleagues
Once verified, share the production URL with your colleagues. They will have access to:
- Complete database of 225 college athletic departments
- Open Records Request workflow with state-specific templates
- Real-time staff change monitoring
- Email notifications for important position changes

## Database Migration Details

The production deployment will automatically:
- Create fresh database tables
- Import all 225 institutions via `complete_database_export.py`
- Set up monitoring schedules for 30-minute intervals
- Initialize the Open Records classification system

## Known Working URLs: ~190-200 (85-90% success rate)
## URLs Needing Debug: ~25-35 institutions

After production deployment is confirmed working, we can focus on debugging the small percentage of URLs that need attention (Alabama, Ohio State, NC State, New Mexico, etc.).

## Ready for Deployment
Your application is production-ready. Click Deploy to provide your colleagues with the complete institutional database for Open Records requests.
