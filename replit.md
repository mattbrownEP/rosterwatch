# Staff Directory Monitor

## Overview

This is a Flask-based web application that monitors staff directory pages for changes and sends email notifications when modifications are detected. The system automatically scrapes specified URLs at regular intervals, detects changes in staff information (additions, removals, modifications), and alerts users via email. It features a web dashboard for managing monitored URLs, viewing change history, and testing email configurations.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Web Framework
- **Flask**: Chosen as the core web framework for its simplicity and flexibility in building the monitoring dashboard and API endpoints
- **SQLAlchemy**: Used as the ORM for database operations with support for multiple database backends
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend framework for responsive UI components with dark theme support

### Database Design
- **SQLite (default) with PostgreSQL support**: Uses SQLite for development/simple deployments, with configurable PostgreSQL support for production
- **Three main entities**:
  - `MonitoredURL`: Stores website information, monitoring status, and user email preferences
  - `StaffChange`: Records detected changes with timestamps and change descriptions
  - `ScrapingLog`: Maintains audit trail of scraping operations and error tracking

### Background Processing
- **APScheduler**: Implements background job scheduling for automated monitoring tasks
- **Interval-based monitoring**: Runs every 30 minutes to check all active URLs for changes
- **Automatic cleanup**: Daily job removes old scraping logs to prevent database bloat

### Web Scraping Engine
- **Requests + BeautifulSoup**: Handles HTTP requests and HTML parsing for extracting staff information
- **Content hashing**: Uses SHA-256 hashing to detect changes efficiently without storing full page content
- **Retry mechanism**: Implements exponential backoff for handling temporary network failures
- **User-agent spoofing**: Mimics browser requests to avoid bot detection

### Email Notification System
- **SMTP integration**: Configurable email service supporting Gmail and other SMTP providers
- **HTML email templates**: Sends formatted change notifications with detailed change descriptions
- **Environment-based configuration**: Email credentials and settings managed through environment variables

### Error Handling & Logging
- **Comprehensive logging**: Debug-level logging throughout the application for monitoring and troubleshooting
- **Graceful error handling**: Network failures and parsing errors are logged without crashing the monitoring process
- **Status tracking**: Maintains success/failure status for each scraping operation

## External Dependencies

### Core Python Libraries
- **Flask**: Web framework and routing
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM and migrations
- **APScheduler**: Background job scheduling
- **Requests**: HTTP client for web scraping
- **BeautifulSoup4**: HTML parsing and content extraction

### Email Services
- **SMTP servers**: Configurable support for Gmail, Outlook, or custom SMTP providers
- **Environment variables**: `SMTP_SERVER`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `FROM_EMAIL`

### Database Support
- **SQLite**: Default embedded database for simple deployments
- **PostgreSQL**: Production database option via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- **Connection pooling**: Configured for production reliability with connection recycling

### Frontend Assets
- **Bootstrap CSS**: Replit's agent dark theme variant for consistent styling
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for UI enhancement
- **CDN delivery**: External CSS and JavaScript assets loaded from CDNs

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Environment variables**: Session secrets, database URLs, and SMTP configuration
- **File system**: Local storage for SQLite database in development mode
- **Network access**: Outbound HTTP/HTTPS for scraping target websites and sending emails
